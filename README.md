 ABOUT ME 
 </p> </H1>

**My Interest to study Information Technology started when setting up blogger was a trend.**

Energetic, Charismatic, and values integrity and hard work. I believe that every action has a reaction, thus I work so hard to make my dream come through. These skills and my strong commitment make me a better person and I continue to invest in myself to be outstanding in my field.

I have a strong interest in software development, data analysis, and technology growth in general. I am a very passionate JavaScript and Python developer. Using JavaScript runtime environment, Node.js, and frameworks such as Express.js, I have worked on different projects such as web based apps and server side web development. I also have experience in using structural framework, AngularJS, and JavaScript library for building UI components, React.js. I have experience using Python for web development (using framework such as Django), and data science (mainly on Jupyter Notebook).

I have done analytic research like creating deep learning model that is aimed to predict the results of European soccer competition using collected data of previous matches. I am using data mining tools and python machine learning libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matploitlib, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, and Keras) to develop the deep learning model. I will be developing an Android and iOS application that users can view the predictions for upcoming games.

I have previous experience working as a Technical Solution Analyst at Cerner and IT Business Analyst at Cummins Inc. I have developed understanding of work environment and what employers expect of their workers. I have also been able to apply my knowledge in real life solutions and developments.

In today's world, we are faced with different issues such as climate change, education equality, and diseases, and am confident that technology will continue to provide solution to these issues. I want to keep learning and helping businesses and people to define different ways old and new technology can be used to impact life positively and promote business productivity and growth.

Projects

**My Personal Interest Includes:**

**- Machine Learnining and Artificial Intelligence:** I see Machine Learning (ML) and Artificail Intelligence (AI) as the catalyst for present and future business and society growth. To increase my ML and AI knowledge, I an recently doing a project that involves researching and creating deep learning model that is aimed to predict the results of European soccer competition using collected data of previous matches. I am using data mining tools and python machine learning libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matploitlib, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, and Keras) to develop the deep learning model. I will be developing an Android and iOS application that users can view the predictions for upcoming games.

**- Data Structure and Algorithm:** Data structures and algorithms play a major role in implementing software. In our daily life, we always go with that person who can complete the task in a short amount of time with efficiency and using fewer resources. Thus, it is iomportant for software engineer and developer to find efficient algorithm in solving issue. Knowledge of data structures like Hash Tables, Trees, Tries, Graphs, and various algorithms goes a long way in solving these problems efficiently and the interviewers are more interested in seeing how candidates use these tools to solve a problem. I implement data structure and algorithm mainly in python language and JavaScript. I have had experience developing efficient algortithm when designing website for different client all over the world.

**- Database Administrator and Business Intelligence:** I took a database class where I developed a sales database for Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a national park in Minnesota. I create a database model that connect every entities involved in the sales process in the park. I worked with Oracle SQL to create the database script and queries for accessing, maintaining and defining the data.

**- IT ANALYST:** My previous experience as an analyst as improved my skill of Understanding business and technology needs, and designing, analyzing and implementing efficient IT systems. I want to help businesses to define different ways technology can be used to increase productivity and growth.

**- Project Management:** To further strengthen my project management skill, I recently built a responsive a forum web platform that gives Africans voice to speak against the corruption, and shares insight on trending issues in the continent. I use Agile methodology for the development. I am donating 20% of the revenue I made from google ad adense to charity homes for children that need help.
